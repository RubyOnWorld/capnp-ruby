# Ruby Edition

This is here is a [Ruby][ruby] compiler for the [Cap'n Proto]() data interchange format.

# Status

I'm currently bootstrapping this library with some really, really nasty
throw away code in `bootstrap/`. Once the initial schema reader is
ready, I'll chunk `bootstrap/` and write a proper compiler. My current
goal is to have that done in the next week (8/18), at which point
this project will be ready for contributions.
